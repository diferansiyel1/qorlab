# QORLAB - UI/UX DESIGN SYSTEM & SPECIFICATIONS

**Version:** 2.0
**Design Philosophy:** "Clinical Clarity, Light-First, Glove-Friendly."
**Target Environment:** Wet labs, Animal facilities, office research stations (bright + low light).

## 1. CORE VISUAL IDENTITY

### 1.1 Color Palette (Scientific & Clinical)
The app must support **Light Mode as default** and **Dark Mode on demand** (essential for low-light labs).

* **Primary (Brand):** `Clinical Blue` (#2D6BFF) - Primary actions (Save, Start).
* **Secondary (Action):** `Warm Amber` (#F2A33A) - Highlights and attention.
* **Success:** `Sterile Green` (#19A974) - Confirmation and safe results.
* **Alert (Danger):** `Biohazard Red` (#E04848) - Safety warnings, stop buttons.
* **Background (Light):** `Lab White` (#F7F8FA) - High readability in bright offices.
* **Background (Dark):** `Deep Lab Navy` (#0C111A) - Low-light reduction.
* **Surface Cards:** Clean layers with subtle borders (1px #E5E8EE in light, #2A3342 in dark).

### 1.2 Typography
* **Headings & UI:** IBM Plex Sans (bold, precise, clinical feel).
* **Data & Numbers:** **Monospace** IBM Plex Mono.
    * *Rationale:* Tabular alignment is critical for comparing molarity or doses.
    * *Size:* Minimum 18sp for data values.

## 2. INTERACTION MODELS (THE "GLOVE" STANDARD)

### 2.1 The "Thumb Zone" Rule
* **Requirement:** In "Lab Mode", 100% of interactions must be achievable with a single thumb.
* **Zone:** The bottom 40% of the screen is for Buttons and Inputs. The top 60% is for Display/Read-only.
* **Touch Targets:**
    * **Minimum Size:** 56x56dp (Standard is 48dp, we need larger for gloves).
    * **Padding:** Minimum 16dp between clickable elements to prevent accidental clicks.

### 2.2 Input Methods
* **Custom Numpad:** Do NOT use the system keyboard for calculations.
    * Build a custom in-app numeric keypad.
    * Keys: `0-9`, `.`, `DELETE`, `NEXT`.
    * Reason: System keyboards are too small and cover the context.
* **Slider/Stepper:** For small adjustments (e.g., pH 7.2 -> 7.4), use giant `+` / `-` stepper buttons instead of typing.

### 2.3 Haptic Feedback (Tactile Confirmation)
* **Events:** Every button press, timer completion, and warning alert MUST trigger haptic feedback.
* **Rationale:** Users often cannot look at the screen while pipetting; they need to "feel" the click.

## 3. SCREEN-SPECIFIC SPECIFICATIONS

### 3.1 Dashboard (Lab Hub)
* **Layout:** Clear vertical flow with "Active Experiment", "Modes", and "Recent Activity".
* **Modes:** Single swipe switcher between **Logbook** and **Lab Tools**.
* **Status Bar:** Top strip showing "Synced/Offline" and date.

### 3.2 "Lab Mode" (Active Experiment View)
This is the distinct mode when an experiment is running.

* **Visual State:** The top navigation bar and bottom tab bar disappear. Full immersive mode.
* **Layout:**
    * **Top 50%:** "The Stream". A chronological log of voice notes, photos, and auto-logged data (Twitter/Timeline style).
    * **Bottom 50%:** "Control Deck".
        * Giant Mic Button (Center).
        * Photo Button (Left).
        * Quick Data Input (Right).
* **Wake Lock:** Screen stays ON permanently in this mode.

### 3.3 Smart Multi-Timer (The Vertical Gantt)
* **Structure:** Vertical Stack List.
* **Visual Logic:**
    * **Active Step:** Expanded card, bright color progress bar filling left-to-right. Remaining time shown in huge font (64sp).
    * **Upcoming Step:** Collapsed card, grayed out, showing "Next: Washing (10m)".
    * **Completed Step:** Collapsed, Green Checkmark icon.
* **Parallelism:** If two timers run simultaneously, they stack vertically, both highlighted.

### 3.4 In-Vivo Calculator (Safety First)
* **Input:** Weight Input Field (Auto-focus).
* **Output:** Dynamic Cards that change color based on safety.
    * *Safe:* "0.2 mL" (Green Background).
    * *Warning:* "0.6 mL" (Yellow Background - High Volume).
    * *Danger:* "1.2 mL" (Red Background - Exceeds Ethical Limit).

## 4. FEEDBACK & ALERTS

### 4.1 Toasts & Snackbars
* **Position:** Top of the screen (Bottom is covered by hand/thumb).
* **Duration:** Longer than standard (4 seconds) to allow reading while working.

### 4.2 Voice Interaction Visuals
* **Listening State:** When the mic is active, display a "Waveform" animation at the bottom to confirm audio is being received.
* **Processing State:** Show "Transcribing..." text.

## 5. ASSET GUIDELINES FOR AI AGENTS

* **Icons:** Use `Lucide` or `Material Symbols Rounded`. Avoid thin strokes; use filled or thick strokes for visibility.
* **Charts:** Use `fl_chart` for line graphs. Lines must be thick (3px minimum) with distinct colored dots for data points.
